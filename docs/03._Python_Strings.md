## What is a String?

- In Python A string is a sequence of characters. No more, no less. The characters can be letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.
- In Python, anything inside quotation marks is referred to as a "string". You can use either single or double quotes.
- Using double quotes has the advantage of allowing a single quote character to be included in the string.

##String Operators

**The `+` operator**

- The `**+` operator\*\* combines two strings into one(Concatenates)

```python
#Example 1
middle_name = ‘Mary’
last_name = ‘Oaks’
middle_name + last_name

#Example 2
print('Welcome to the Data Armory'+ 'for data science insights')
```

**The bracket operator**

- The **bracket operator** allows us to access individual characters in a string. It takes an index as an argument and returns the character at that position in the string. For example, to get the first letter of the string `name` we can use the bracket operator like this:

```python

name = 'japheth'
first_letter = name[0]
print(first_letter)

```

- We can also use negative indices to access characters from the end of the string.

```python
name = 'Kepha'
last_letter = name[-1]
print(last_letter)

```

- `string[:i] + string [i:]` will be equal to string.

```python
String = 'procrastination'

new_string = string[:3] + string [3:]
```

```python

```

- Negative indices begin with -1, and `0` is equivalent to `0`.

**The `*`operator**

- In Python, **the `*`operator** can be used to create multiple copies of a string. Here are some examples:

```python

#Example 1

string = "Welcome"
print(string * 3)

#Example 2
empty_string = " " * 7
print(empty_string)
```

- If several string literals are placed together, they will be combined into a single string.

```python
name = 'Ellen' 'White'
print(name)
```

- This feature is especially helpful when needing to divide long strings.
- NB: Put strings within parentheses.

```python
long_string = ('This feature is especially helpful' 'when needing to divide long strings')
```

- It is not possible to concatenate a variable and a string literal.

```python
long_string = 'This feature is especially helpful'
new_string = long_string' + 'when needing to divide long strings'
new_string
```

- Use the + operator to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal.

### #**Double Quotes**

```python
car_make = “This is Mr. Ken’s Honda”
kens_likes = ‘Does mr. Ken "love"data science’
```

### **#Escape Characters**

- To use both single and double quotes in a string, you must use escape characters.
- An escape character enables you to use characters that would otherwise be impossible to include in a string.
- An escape character is a backslash (\) followed by the desired character to be included in the string. This allows for special characters, such as quotation marks, to be used without disrupting the string.

```python
\' To add a Single quote
car = 'This is Mr. Ken\'s car'

\" To add Double quote
her_husband = "He is a \"good\" man"

\t To add Tab
welcome_message = 'How did you know\tAbout the data Armory\tMake sure you share and subscribe'

\n To add a Newline (line break)
welcome_message = 'How did you know\nAbout the data Armory\nMake sure you share and subscribe'

\\ To use Backslash
back_slash = ' An escape character is a backslash \\'
```

- Without the use of print(), a new line character (\n) will be included in the output.

```python
welcome_message = 'How did you know\tAbout the data Armory\tMake sure you share and subscribe'
welcome_message
```

- A backslash can be placed at the end of a line to ignore the newline character.
- A backslash (\) indicates that the current line should be continued on the next line. It is used to break up a long line of code into smaller sections for readability.

```python
welcome_message = 'my name'\
    ' is called'\
        ' jane'
print(welcome_message)
```

### **#Raw String**

- A raw string ignores all escape characters and prints any backslash it contains. No special treatment is given to the backslash.

```python
welcome_message = r'How did you know\tAbout the data Armory\tMake sure you share and subscribe'
print(welcome_message)
```

- There is an important consideration when using raw strings, which is that it cannot end with an uneven number of \ characters.

```python
welcome_message = r'How did you know\About the data Armory\Make sure you share and subscribe\'
print(welcome_message)
```

- How to end a raw string with an odd number of backslashes.

```python
#Use regular strings and double the backslashes:

welcome_message = 'How did you know\\About the data Armory\\Make sure you share and subscribe\\'
print(welcome_message)
```

### **#len function**

- The len() function can be used to determine the number of characters in a string. In this case, using the len() function on the string `name` would return the value `12`.

```python
name = ‘ken walibora’
```

### **#Stripping Whitespace**

- The `rstrip()` method can be used to remove any extra whitespace from the right end of a string. For example:

```python
name = 'ken walibora '
name = name.rstrip()
```

This code will remove any extra whitespace from the right side of the string, leaving the string as `'ken walibora'`.

### **#Multiline String**

- String literals can span multiple lines and are delimited by either three single quotes or three double quotes. For example, to create a multiline string in Python we can write:

```python
my_string = """
This is a multiline string in Python.
It is delimited by triple quotes.
"""
```

### **#String slices**

- Python allows for string slicing, which means accessing a specific portion of a string.
- A section of a string is referred to as a slice, from the nth character to the mth character, including the first but not the last.
- Like lists, strings in Python can be accessed using indexes and slices. The syntax for slicing a string is the same as slicing a list, with the start and end indices separated by a colon. For example, `string[0]` would return the first character of the string, while `string[0:3]` would return the first three characters.
- Because Python (like many programming languages) uses [zero-based indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#:~:text=Zero%2Dbased%20numbering%20is%20a,mathematical%20or%20non%2Dprogramming%20circumstances.)

The syntax is as follows:

```python
string[start:end]

```

Here are some examples:

**Code Example:**

```python
string = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
print(string[4:9])  # Output: "quick"
print(string[0:3])  # Output: "The"
print(string[16:])  # Output: "fox jumps over the lazy dog"
```

Yes, in Python you can capture a slice from one string variable and store it in a separate string variable using slicing notation. For example, to capture the first three characters of the string variable `name` and store it in a separate variable `first_three`, you can use the following code:

```python
name = 'Pythonistas'
first_three = name[:3]

```

This will store the string `'ken'` in the variable `first_three`.

- If the first index is equal to or greater than the second, the result will be an empty string shown as two quotation marks with nothing between them.

Here are some tips and tricks for indexing and slicing strings in Python:

1. String slicing: You can extract a substring from a string using slicing, which is done by specifying a range of indices separated by a colon. For example, **`my_string[1:4]`** would give you a substring starting at the second character and ending at the fourth.
2. Negative indexing and slicing: You can also index and slice strings from right to left using negative indices. For example, **`my_string[-1]`** would give you the last character, and **`my_string[-4:-1]`** would give you a substring starting from the fourth character from the end and ending at the second-to-last.
3. Slice step: You can also specify a step size in the slice, which allows you to skip characters in the string. For example, **`my_string[0:6:2]`** would give you every other character from the first to the fifth character.
4. Immutable strings: It's important to remember that strings in Python are immutable, which means you cannot modify them directly. However, you can create new strings by concatenating or slicing existing strings.

- By mastering these indexing and slicing techniques, you can efficiently manipulate and extract substrings from strings in your Python code.
- Using negative numbers can be useful when working with strings of unknown length or when you want to access characters starting from the end of the string.
- You can reverse a string using slicing by specifying a step of -1. For example:

```python
s = "The_data_armory"
s[::-1]  # reverse the string

```

- you can also use indexing to combine strings. For example:

```python
s1 = "data"
s2 = "armory"
s1[0] + s2[0]
```

### **#The in and not in Operators**

The `in` and `not in` operators in Python can be used to check if a substring is present or absent, respectively, in a given string. The operator returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on whether the substring is found in the string or not. For example:

```python
# using the in operator
text = "The Data Armory is your best coding platform"
if "best" in text:
    print("The word 'bext' is present in the text")

# using the not in operator

text = "The Data Armory is your best coding platform"
if "missing" in text:
    print("The word 'missing' is not present in the text")

```

Output:

```python
The word 'sample' is present in the text
The word 'missing' is not present in the text

```

- These operators can be useful for various string operations, such as searching for a specific substring or checking if a password meets certain requirements.
- These membership operators can be used with a wide range of Python objects that support membership testing, such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and strings.

#Simple Looping and counting program;

```python
word = 'bananas in the banana plantation farm in a banana region'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count += 1
print(count)

#Function

def count(word ,number):

    for letter in word:
        if letter == 'a':
            number = number + 1

    print(number)

count('Banana',0)
```

### **#String Comparison**

To check if two strings are equal, you can use the `==` operator. For example:

```python
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "world"
string3 = "hello"

print(string1 == string2) # False
print(string1 == string3) # True

```

In this example, `string1` is not equal to `string2`, but it is equal to `string3`.

Here are some tips and tricks for comparing strings in Python:

1. String comparison: You can also compare two strings to determine which one is greater or lesser than the other, based on their ASCII values. For example, **`if my_string1 < my_string2:`** will evaluate to **`True`** if **`my_string1`** comes before **`my_string2`** in alphabetical order.
2. Case sensitivity: By default, string comparison in Python is case-sensitive, which means that "apple" and "Apple" are considered different strings. If you want to perform a case-insensitive comparison, you can convert the strings to lowercase or uppercase using the **`lower()`** or **`upper()`** method before comparing them.

### #String Methods

Several string methods can be used to analyze strings or create transformed string values. This section describes the methods that you will use most frequently.

Here are some examples of Python string methods:

- `upper()`: Returns the string in all uppercase letters.

```
name = "John"
print(name.upper())
# Output: JOHN

```

- `lower()`: Returns the string in all lowercase letters.

```
name = "JOHN"
print(name.lower())
# Output: john

```

- `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings, separated by the specified delimiter.

```
text = "This is a sentence."
words = text.split()
print(words)
# Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sentence.']

```

- `strip()`: Removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string.

```
text = "       hello     "
print(text.strip())
# Output: "hello"

```

- Whitespace in programming is any non-visual character, such as spaces, tabs, and end-of-line symbols, which can be used to structure output for readability.

```python
name = "Ken\n\tJackson\n\t"
print(name)
```

- `replace()`: Replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with another substring.

```
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
new_text = text.replace("fox", "cat")
print(new_text)
# Output: "The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog."

# Use the upper() method to convert the string to uppercase
print(my_string.upper())

# Use the lower() method to convert the string to lowercase
print(my_string.lower())

# Use the replace() method to replace a substring in the string
print(my_string.replace("Hello", "Hi"))

# Use the split() method to split the string into a list of substrings
print(my_string.split(","))

```

Some string methods that have names beginning with the word "is" include:

```
my_string = "hello world"

# isalpha() - returns True if all characters in the string are alphabetic
print(my_string.isalpha()) # False

# isdigit() - returns True if all characters in the string are digits
print(my_string.isdigit()) # False

# islower() - returns True if all cased characters in the string are lowercase
print(my_string.islower()) # True

# isupper() - returns True if all cased characters in the string are uppercase
print(my_string.isupper()) # False
```

For more information on these and other string methods in Python, see the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

**#Strings are immutable**

In Python, strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string. Here are some examples:

```
string1 = "hello"
string2 = string1.upper() # creates a new string
print(string1) # "hello"
print(string2) # "HELLO"

string1[0] = "H" # raises a TypeError because strings are immutable

```

**#The `dir()` on strings**

The `dir()` function in Python returns a list of all the available attributes and methods of an object. Here are some code examples using `dir()` on strings:

```
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Get all available attributes and methods of the string object
print(dir(my_string))
```

Here are some tips and tricks for using the **`dir()`** function on Python strings:

1. Viewing string attributes and methods: The output of **`dir()`** on a string object will include all the attributes and methods that can be used with that object. This can be useful for discovering new methods or attributes that you might not have known existed.
2. String attributes: The output of **`dir()`** on a string object will also include a number of string attributes, such as **`__class__`**, **`__doc__`**, and **`__len__()`**. These attributes can be used to obtain information about the string object, such as its class, documentation, or length.
3. Using help(): To obtain more information about a specific attribute or method that you find in the output of **`dir()`**, you can use the built-in **`help()`** function. Simply pass the attribute or method as an argument to **`help()`**, and it will display the documentation and usage information for that attribute or method.

### #String Formatting

**#Old way of formatting**

The `%` operator in Python is used to format strings by replacing placeholders with the values of variables. Here are a few examples of using the `%` operator in Python:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))

```

This will output:

```
My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

```

```
price = 19.99
print("The price of the product is $%.2f." % price)

```

- The %s string substitution operator / string formatting operator is used to indicate where to insert the value of the variable name as a string.

```python
quantity = 3
item = "apple"
print("I bought %d %s%s." % (quantity, item, "s" if quantity > 1 else ""))
```

This will output:

```python
I bought 3 apples.
```

- If you need to make multiple substitutions in a single string, you have to enclose the right-hand side in a tuple, as the % operator only accepts one argument.

- You can perform variable substitutions by name in your format string by passing a mapping to the % operator.

```python

print("I bought %(quantity)d %(item)s." % {'quantity':3 , 'item':'apple'})
```

**#The New Method in Python 3**

- Use the **`format()`** method: The **`format()`** method is the most commonly used string formatting method in Python. It allows you to insert values into a string using placeholders, which can be numbered, named, or positional.

```python
print("My name is {}." . format('Ken'))

#example 2

name = 'Andrew'
print("My name is {}." . format(name))
```

- Specify the data type: When using placeholders in the **`format()`** method, you can specify the data type of the value being inserted, such as integer, float, or string, by adding a formatting specifier, like **`{0:d}`** for integer, **`{1:f}`** for float, or **`{2:s}`** for string.

```python
print("My name is {} and I am {:f} years old." . format('Ken', 35))
```

**#Use f-strings: f-strings**

- Use f-strings: f-strings (or formatted string literals) are a newer way of formatting strings in Python 3.6 and later. They allow you to embed expressions and variables directly into a string using curly braces **`{}`** and prefixing the string with the letter 'f'.

```python
name = 'Jerry'
print(f'my name is {name}')
```

### #Built in Strings Functions

- The **`ord()`**function is useful for working with Unicode characters and strings in Python, as it allows you to convert characters to their corresponding code points and vice versa. Here's an example:

```python

ord('d')
```

- The **`ord()`** function is the inverse of the **`chr()`**function, which takes a Unicode code point and returns the corresponding character. Here's an example:

```python
char(190)
```
