## Variables in Python.

- In python, a **variable** is a name that is used to hold/store a **value** or an object.

  > A **value** in this case, is the information that is stored/linked to a variable.

  > A value can be a string of letters (string) or a number (integer.)

- A variable is given a value using the equal sign/ assignment operator.

- For an assignment statement

- We need a _variable name,assignment operator and the value_.

Example:

```py
text = "Hello World"
message = "Welcome to the Data Armory" # = sign is the assignment operator
score = 12 #12 is the value

# In line 1 `Text` is the variable name
# In line 2 `=` sign is the assignment operator
# In line 3 `12` is the value
```

NB:

- The type of variable will be the type of value that it refers to.
- Once Stored you can use it anywhere else.

* You can always assign different values to different variables.

```py
#Code Example
a,b,c = 10,'come','again!'
```

- You can also assign one value to different variables.

```py
#Code Example
d = e= f = 100
```

## Variable Names Rules and Guidelines

- We have to agree that variable names are an essential part of the source code and meaningful names are important when it comes to program comprehension.
- They serve as an implied documentation that conveys to the reader;

  > The meaning of the code.

  > The intention of the writer.

- Considering that sometimes names are the only documentation, then clean code approach should be highly regarded.
- Therefore, it is important to devote a considerable amount of time to the issue of variable naming and therefore the variable names and rules. [Source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07487.pdf)

- A variable name _CAN_ be one word, though not a Must

```py
student  = 'Ken'
print(student)
```

- You _SHOULD_ separate words with underscores and not spaces.

```py
student_name = 'Ken'
print(student_name)
```

```py
student_name = 'George'
print(student_name)
```

- When naming variable's we _SHOULD_ only use alpha-numeric characters (letters and numbers) and the underscore character.

```py
student_1 = 'Mary'
print(student_1)
```

- You _SHOULD NOT_ start a variable name with a number, but you _CAN_ start with a letter or an underscore character.

```py
student* = 'Caro
```

    > Breaking this rule will give you an invalid decimal literal or syntax error

```py

1_student = 'Henry'
_student = 'John'
_student
```

- A variable name _SHOULD_ start with a letter or the underscore character.
- You _SHOULD NOT_ use python keywords and function names as variable names.

```py
pass = 'John'
```

- Variable names are case sensitive

  > message, Message, MESSAGE and MeSsAge are different

```py
message = 'Come here'
Message = 'Welcome  home'
MESSAGE = 'This is the  data armory'
MeSSaGe = 'Thank  for watching'
```

```py

print(message)
print(Message)
print(MESSAGE)
print(MeSSaGe)
```

- Ensure that variable names are;
  > Short: though they can be long.
  > Descriptive: That is can tell what the variable is used for.

```py
weather_df = "Australia.csv"
data = "Australia.csv"
```

- Take note that some letters like lowercase l and uppercase letter O can easily be confused with number 1 and 0.

- While it is legal to use upper case letters;

  > Others think it is a good idea to start variable names with lower case letter.

  > Others believe that they better use camel case than separate names with

  > Other avoid starting variables names with an underscore, unless when they are writing library code.
