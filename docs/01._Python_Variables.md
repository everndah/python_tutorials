## Variables in Python. 

In python a **variable** is a name  that is used to hold/store a **value** or an object .
> A **value** in this case,is the information that is stored/linked to a variable. 

> A value can be a letter(String  of  letters) or a number(Integer).

A variable is given a value using the equal sign/ assignment operator.

For an assignment statement

We need a *variable name,assignment operator and the value*.

Example: 

```py 

text = "Hello World"
message = "Welcome to the Data Armory"
score = 12 

```

NB: 
- The type of variable will be  the type of value that it  refers to.
- Once Stored you can use it anywhere else.


* You can always assign different values to different variables.

``` py
#Code Example
a,b,c = 10,'come','again!' 
```
* You can also assign one value to different variables.

``` py
#Code Example
 
d=e= f = 100 

```

Next we shall look at a few rules and guidelines for naming variables
