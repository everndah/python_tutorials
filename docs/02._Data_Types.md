## What is a data type?

- A data type is basically a category in which a value belongs to.

      > Meaning that data types can be divided into categories like Numeric,Sequence Type etc.
      > Knowing the data type helps one know the kind of operations that can be done on the value.

- Every value that is held by a variable has a data type.

```py
name = 'Tony'
students = 10
height = 10.5
```

- To view the type you need to use the type() function.

```py
#View Types
type(name)
```

- Although there are numerous data types, there are certain data types which are commonly used in Python.

- Common data types are categorized under primitive data types, and these include integers, strings, Booleans, and floating points.

- Other primitives include the Boolean and None Types.

## Numeric Data Types

- This is data that has numeric value

### Integers

- An integer is a value that is a whole number (+/-).

```py

#Integer
cars = 100
type(cars)
```

```py
#Negative Value
temprature = -25
type(temprature)
```

### Floats

- A Float (Floating point number) is a number that has a decimal

```py
#Float
height = 100.5
type(height)
```

## Sequence Type

- In python, a sequence is the ordered collection of data types that are either similar or different.

  > An example of this includes strings, lists, and tuples.

- A string is a text value

### String

```py
make = 'Toyota'
type(make)
```

```py
#Empty String
color = ''
type(color)
```

```py
#Number as a string
number_of_children = '11'
type(number_of_children )
```

## Boolean

- This data type has either True or False built in values.

       > N/B: T and F have to be capitalized.

```py
y = True
type(y)
x = False
type(x)
```

## None-Type

- The data type has a single value None which points to the absence of a value.

```py
#Empty Value
number_of_people = None

# Check None-Type
type(number_of_people)
```

- You can specify a specific Data Type

```py
#Specify String
count = str(11)
type(count)
```

```py
#Specify Integer
height = int(10.5)
type(height)
```

```py
## Operation on a string and an integer
Bus_one = '10'
Bus_two = 11

total = Bus_one + Bus_two
print(total)
```

```py
# Correct Operation on a string and an integer
Bus_one = int('10')
Bus_two = 11
total = Bus_one + Bus_two
print(total)
```

```py

#Assignment  Concatenate a str to a str
Bus_one = '10'
Bus_two = str(11)

total = Bus_one + Bus_two
```
